  <Step title="Edit and Iterate" icon="settings">
    Review the output, tweak text or visuals, and regenerate sections.

    Use inline editors for:

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Editing and Customization

Fine-tune outputs for perfection.

  <Expandable title="Custom Prompts" default-open="true">
    Enhance generations with structured inputs:

    ```json
    {
      "plot": "Hero's journey",
      "length": "20 pages",
      "audience": "ages 6-10",
      "visualStyle": "watercolor"
    }

    Experiment with parameters like tone (`humorous`) or pacing (`fast-paced`).
